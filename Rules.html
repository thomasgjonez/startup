            Catch Phrase is an online game where each team takes turns guessing a word based off of a fellow teamates description. 
            When the buzzer sounds, whatever team is trying to guess a word loses and the opposing team scores apoint and moves their team piece ahead one square.
            The game continues until one team has reached the end.
        </p>
        <p>When providing a description for the word one may not:
            <li>Mention the word</li>
            <li>Say what letters it starts with</li>
            <li>Say it ryhmes with...</li>
        </p>
