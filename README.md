# Catch Phrase Online

[My Notes](notes.md)



> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Catch Phrase is a word game where you try to explain your random generated word to your teamates so that they can guess it. After guessing the word it is now the other teams turn, but be careful if the buzzer goes off while you're still trying to guess the word, your team loses and the other team moves their piece forward 1 spot. The game is over when a team's piece reaches the end, which means they are the winners. The webiste will host this game online where individuals can make accounts and play with their friends with a game/room code while chatting.

### Key features

- Login/register: Each player is required to make an account to play the game meaning each player has a unique username that will be displayed when playing the game with others. All stored on database
- Catch Phrase game: The game is displayed for everyone to see their team pieces on the board. Each user is randomly assigned a team(equal number on both sides). Players try to guess what the word is depending on the description
                     their teamate gives them, which appears to everyone in the game. Keep going until buzzer is sounded
- Chat bar below the game for general chat amongst everyone

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic Structure, will need two maybe three html pages for home, game, and account. Rules and other things will be pop up text boxes
- **CSS** - Making the Structure look more creative and animation of the game
- **React** - User authentication, game info, display teammate guesses and chat, backend endpoint calls
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints to:
    - Submitting guesses
    - Managing game state(buzzer, win condition, words, turns, score, etc)
    - User authentication
    - **APIs**
      - Auth0(login authentication)
      - Meriam Webster Dictionary
- **DB/Login** - Store users in database, which must register and sign in to play the game. Credentials securely stored in database. Potential to add a friend list
- **WebSocket** - game state synchronization, displaying chat messages & words

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://cs260-catchphrase.click/).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - 4 pages for each of the different functions of my website. Names are self-explanatory and index is the homepage
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - Mainly used headers, tables, divs, and paragraphs with general classes and unique ids to separate my content, which I will further style with CSS to create more distinction
- [x] **Links** - I created multiple hrefs for navigation links or links to other places
- [x] **Text** - I completed this part with various text throughout my site
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I explicitly commetted in both text and comments on where my apis will go 
- [x] **Images** - I inserted images using img src method, images are uploaded to my repo
- [x] **Login placeholder** - There are sign in boxes and a submit button
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - There are tables that will eventually pull out your information like username
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - There is a live chat box with a placeholder for the websocket.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Header contains the webnavigation, and Footer contains the live chat, which are styled accordling on the game page. The other pages I didn't need to use header or footer. Main contains most of my styling, which I organized with bootstrap and overided with CSS when needed.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - Navigation has been given a background color along with "buttons" that are gray and change color as you hover over them. Also added a section for your Username to show up.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - I mainly used bootstrap to organize the layout of my pages, which meant that I could resize easily. You'll notice that the "column" sectionns of the page switch their orientation as you make your window smaller.
- [x] **Application elements** - I used bootstrap for the basics and overrided with some css for various elements in my website such as headers, paragraphs, buttons, and tables. Tables especially took me a while to figure out how to properly style them with alternating colors for various rows.
- [x] **Application text content** - I changed the font, color, size, and if it was bold depending on what the text contained and where it was located. I even imported a font called Anton for my Catchphrase title.
- [x] **Application images** - The main thing I did with this was layer the board pieces on top of the actual game board and position them in a nice way, which took a long time to get right. A lot of pixel incrementing. 

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - I completed this part by downloading vite and adjusting the package.json file
- [x] **Components** - I made several components that are all found under the /src/pages, such as login, create-account, game, and rules, which will load in after their respective navlink is pressed or when your browser is routed there. Also there are the header(navigation links) and footer(live chat) components which was a little bit tricker as I only wanted the header and footer to appear in certain pages so I had to get a little creative with nested routing and making two layout jsx files called HomeLayout(for login and create-account) and MainLayout(for game and rules).
- [x] **Router** - Like I said before I did some research and found a solution to having the two layouts, which included some nested routing. Basically everything is wrapped in the BowserRouter then I have a router for both HomeLayout and MainLayout(probably should change the names lol). These act like parent routers, which then have routers within to get various components, inheriting the formats of their parents and thus achieving two formats of the website.
## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - I completed this part and you'll be able to see that you need to create an account to access the game. The game functions similiarly to the future final result, but there are some extra details that are included. All you need to do is click set teams, which sets the teams and game conditions and then play game to start playing, which will switch team turns when you guess the word right. For testing purposes, the word will always be apple. As you get points the scoreboard will update and move your pieces. Then check win conditions and alert who wins.
- [x] **Hooks** - I used hooks such as useState to manage game state, including team scores, player turns, timers, and word guessing. The useEffect hook is used for several key functionalities: initializing the room code from localStorage, handling the countdown timer, updating the game state when a word is guessed correctly, picking whos turn it is to describe the word, and repositioning game pieces based on score changes. These hooks ensure the game state remains reactive and synchronized across different user interactions. Additionally, I used hooks to manage authenticated pages, basically you have to log in, which saves to local storage, to access game and rule sections of the site and it remebers the user as well.

## ðŸš€ Service deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - I completed this part and have a functioning server, which is lauched through node.js
- [X] **Static middleware for frontend** - The main middleware I implemented for this phase was requireAuth, which checks that a user is authorized with a authToken as endpoints are called, which most game endpoints are restrictive endpoints. There is also the error handling middleware.
- [X] **Calls to third party endpoints** - Random Word calls a third party endpoint with api nija, which returns a random word object. Note I call this endpoint in the gameHelper.js since that made more since as the game calls the method and not a person.
- [X] **Backend service endpoints** - I implemented a lot of endpoints for this project, including ones that create, login, and logout a user. Also the game endpoints include: createOrJoinRoom , setTeam, playGame, getGameState etc.Live chat endpoints include addMessage, getChatMessages. Most of these endpoints are fairly intuitive and mixed with a lot of helper functions.
- [X] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - All endpoints are succesfully called through either time intervals(for the endpoints that get the gameState or chatMessages) or buttons that are explicit on what they do. Additionally, I use the use effect as well to update the gameState to the frontend. However, that has proven problematic with updating the UI across various users in the same game. Hopefully the websocket fixes these issues.

Please note, as the project currently stands at the end of this phase, it can be buggy when it comes to consistency across various user sessions in the UI and the data doesn't upload as correctly as it should, but that will be fixed when databases and websockets are implemented.(It seemed to work better in my local host though) As far as the specifications for this certain phase, everything is working. Also until you actually enter in the gameRoom the get gameState endpoin(called every 2 seconds) will return failed status.

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **User registration** - Stores username, email, hashedpassword, and authToken into a collection called user on mongo.
- [x] **User login and logout** - if a user is found in the db and the passwords are the same then it adds an authToken to the user in the database and allows you to hit protected endpoints such as playing the game. Logout makes your authToken null and exits you to the home menu where you can login in again.
- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - There are three collections in my database for the startup. User, game, and chat. User stores the username, password, email, and authToken. Game stores all the needed information specific to a unique game marked by its roomCode. Chat stores the messages made by users, which is deleted every 30 seconds so you don't have an exponentially growing chat message box at the bottom of the page. I'm looking into Mongo further so that I can just display the most recent messages and not delete the chat every 30 seconds. For this delieveralbe my current method is sufficient. 
- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - I have my credentials stored in a file in the service directory
- [x] **Restricts functionality based on authentication** - Like I mentioned before, you can't access the game page unless you have an authToken stored in the database.
