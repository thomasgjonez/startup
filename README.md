# Catch Phrase Online

[My Notes](notes.md)



> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Catch Phrase is a word game where you try to explain your random generated word to your teamates so that they can guess it. After guessing the word it is now the other teams turn, but be careful if the buzzer goes off while you're still trying to guess the word, your team loses and the other team moves their piece forward 1 spot. The game is over when a team's piece reaches the end, which means they are the winners. The webiste will host this game online where individuals can make accounts and play with their friends with a game/room code while chatting.

### Key features

- Login/register: Each player is required to make an account to play the game meaning each player has a unique username that will be displayed when playing the game with others. All stored on database
- Catch Phrase game: The game is displayed for everyone to see their team pieces on the board. Each user is randomly assigned a team(equal number on both sides). Players try to guess what the word is depending on the description
                     their teamate gives them, which appears to everyone in the game. Keep going until buzzer is sounded
- Chat bar below the game for general chat amongst everyone

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic Structure, will need two maybe three html pages for home, game, and account. Rules and other things will be pop up text boxes
- **CSS** - Making the Structure look more creative and animation of the game
- **React** - User authentication, game info, display teammate guesses and chat, backend endpoint calls
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints to:
    - Submitting guesses
    - Managing game state(buzzer, win condition, words, turns, score, etc)
    - User authentication
    - **APIs**
      - Auth0(login authentication)
      - Meriam Webster Dictionary
- **DB/Login** - Store users in database, which must register and sign in to play the game. Credentials securely stored in database. Potential to add a friend list
- **WebSocket** - game state synchronization, displaying chat messages & words
