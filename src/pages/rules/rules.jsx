                        Catch Phrase is an online game where each team takes turns guessing a word based off of a fellow teamates description. 
                        When the buzzer sounds, whatever team is trying to guess a word loses and the opposing team scores a point and moves their team piece ahead one square.
                        The game continues until one team has reached the end.

                        <li>Mention the word</li>
                        <li>Say what letters it starts with</li>
                        <li>Say it ryhmes with...</li>
