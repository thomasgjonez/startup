## AWS Notes

I am renting a server that is a t2.nano with a public and elastic ip address: 44.223.153.237 Please note that this is free for a year. Additonally, the elastic ip address will reset when I stop the server. This was all done through AWS EC2 instances. I rented a domain called cs260-catchphrase.click for $3 a year and then made the website secure by editing my caddy file and updating it with my domain name.

### General Notes

During the github excercise I learned how to synch changes made between terminal, vscode, and the online version.
